# borrowers-reliability-research

This project contains borrowers' reliability research. The customer is the bank credit department. In the project, the author explores the influence of the marital status and the number of children of the client on repaying the loan on time. The input data from the bank contains statistics on the solvency of customers.

The research results were taken into account when building a **credit scoring model** (a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank).

**The purpose of the research** is to provide answers to the following questions:

 * Is there a relationship between having children and repaying a loan on time?
 * Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
 * Is there a relationship between income level and loan repayment on time?
 * How do different purposes of a loan affect its repayment on time?
